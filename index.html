                <strong>dear heads and mentors</strong>,<br>
                As our 10-day immersion is coming to an end, I would like to express my deepest 
                appreciation to all of you for your guidance, support, and inspiration throughout 
                this incredible journey. Your dedication to sharing knowledge and expertise in 
                the area of science and technology is absolutely invaluable, and it really touched 
                my heart as a student who aspires to be like you all.<br>

                To the heads who worked closely with us, thank you for your patience, guidance, 
                and encouragement. You not only helped us learn and grow but also created a positive 
                and supportive environment that made this experience truly enjoyable.<br>

                To the other heads who did not hesitate to share their field of expertise with us, 
                I am highly grateful for the opportunities that you have given me. Your willingness 
                to welcome us and share your time has been a gift that I will always treasure.<br>

                I would like to extend further thanks for the lovely treats and the excellent food 
                given to us throughout. Your warmth in showing regard for us during our stay meant 
                so much. It's these small things‚Äîhaving meals shared together‚Äîthat made immersions 
                especially memorable and worthwhile.<br>

                This immersion has been more than just a learning experience; it has been a journey 
                of growth, discovery, and connection. I will carry the lessons and memories I've 
                gained here with me as I continue on my path.<br>

                Thank you for your generosity, guidance, and for believing in our potential. I hope 
                to make you proud as I apply everything I've learned from this experience.<br>

                Maraming maraming salamat po! Mabuhay ang DOST-MIMAROPA!<br>
                Sincerely yours,

                Hi ma'am! I would like to tell you first that you're so bango and cute. In terms of our 
                boss and OJT student talk, I appreciate how approachable and gentle you are. Whenever I 
                have questions, it's not intimidating to approach you. I also love how you explain the 
                work very well and in detail. I had clear insights about DOST-MIMAROPA in terms of its 
                projects. Overall, I am thankful for the trust you've given me with the tasks. I wish 
                you a healthy life, and please don't forget to rest too :)).<br><br>

                <strong>To: Ma'am Pat</strong><br>
                Hi Ma'am! I am eager to tell you that you are so pretty, but I don't have the courage 
                to do so hehe. I'm shy. Pero ayun po, I really like your vibe‚Äîvery jolly and open. 
                You're the kind of person who listens and doesn't judge üòú. I hope you enjoy life! 
                Stay pretty, Ma'am Pat! üíó<br><br>

                <strong>To: Ma'am Dani</strong><br>
                Hi Ma'am Dani üôÇ. I feel so lucky to be in your unit. You are a very nice and 
                approachable boss. On our first day, I thought, "She looks like Vivoree from PBB" 
                (just my little comment hehe). Thank you for making us feel included and comfortable. 
                I wish you and Dancan (sorry for the spelling hehehe) a healthy life and good luck! üíóüíó<br><br>

                <strong>To: Kuya Willow/Wallog</strong><br>
                Kuyaaaaaaaaaa, mamimiss ka namin huhuhu. Thank you for always approaching and 
                talking to us. You made us feel comfortable in the office, and your vibes lightened 
                up our mornings. Thank you for the 10 days of laughter. I hope you feel good at your 
                next post. More chismis! HAHAHA. We'll never forget you. Iwas na sa kape at pancit 
                canton combo üòÅ. Take care always! :))

                At first, kabado po talaga ako, as in, siguro I expected na sa loob ng office, may masungit, boss na palaging galit, and mga taong stressed na sa trabaho. Tapos dumagdag pa kami kung kelan year end na.
                <br>
                At the same time, hindi pa po ako decided kung anong gusto ko maging trabaho ‚Äî IT ba, anong klaseng IT, kaya ba, siguro?? Those kinds of questions pumapasok sa isip ko kada tinatanong ako. But now, a lot has already changed in quite a short time.
                <br>
                The first week, binusog nyo na po agad kami ‚Äî binusog ng mga trabaho, <strong>HAHAHA</strong> and busog talaga sa pagkain! I'm really <strong>thankFULL</strong> everytime na binibigyan nyo po kami, like matagal na kaming part of the office.
                <br>
                I really enjoyed my Immersion at <strong>DOST-Mimaropa</strong>! Buhay na buhay po ang office dahil sa inyong lahat!

(Yan lang po natatandaan ko, I'm not good with names po, basta narinig ko po lahat ng names dyan, hehehe.) But still, I will remember all of your vibes, and dadalhin until I find a workplace like yours.
                <br>
                Thank you for making this year very special for me! Na-clutch nyo po yun, kala ko 2024 will be one of my worst, nabaliktad nyo po yun somehow, that's why I'm very happy!
